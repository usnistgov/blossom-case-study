# Case Study: Shifting Left the Right Way with OSCAL

This repository was created to demonstrate an automated assessment workflow using GitHub Actions.  It utilizes a minimal application to trace a single control through the OSCAL models.

Through this project, we intend to help take the first steps with OSCAL and integrate these concepts into a development project. This will facilitate security, privacy and compliance activities as a part of an application development project from the start.

## Demo Branch

Branches prefixed with `step_` are demonstration branches.
These branches show the progression of developing and integrating privacy and security requirements as early as possible in an application (i.e. "shifting left") using workflows centered around OSCAL.
For more details, see the `main` branch.
